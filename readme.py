#1. Database Development for a Music Library
#Objective: The aim of this assignment is to apply foundational knowledge of Data Definition Language (DDL) to create, modify, and manage a music library database. This involves establishing table structures, defining relationships, and ensuring data integrity for storing information about albums, artists, and genres.

#Task 1: SQL Table Creation

#Problem Statement: You need to create tables named Albums, Genre, and Artists that will store information about music. The Albums table should include columns for album ID, title, artist ID, genre ID, release year, and total tracks. You have to decide what data should be included in the Genre and Artist tables.
#Expected Outcome: Tables are successfully created through DDL statements.
#Task 2: SQL Alteration

#Problem Statement: After creating the Albums table, you realize that you need to add a column for the album's total duration in minutes.
#Expected Outcome: The Albums table is successfully modified to include a new column duration for the total duration of the album.
#Task 3: SQL Foreign Key Establishment

#Problem Statement: Establish a relationship between the Albums table and the Artists and Genre tables (assuming the Artists and Genre tables exist with an id column). Ensure that each album is linked to an existing artist and genre in the Artists and Genre table respectively.
#Expected Outcome: Foreign key constraints are successfully added to the Albums table ensuring referential integrity between the tables.
#EXTRA CREDIT:  Create an ERD for this assignment.
